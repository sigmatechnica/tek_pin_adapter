Tektronix BNC pin adapter

# Instructions

There is a lot of variability in 3D printers and there is some variability in BNC connecters as well.  Some experimentation will be required to get the sizing right.

Parts needed:
9mm pogo pin such as this:

appropriate resistor.  for a 100x probe that's about 6k, for a 10x probe that's about 11k.  tolerances aren't critical.

a suitable probe.  If it already has a plastic shroud on the BNC, this can likely be removed to expose a relatively normal BNC underneath. 

## Steps:
1) print part
2) trim flanged base off pogo pin with clippers and file smooth.
3) drill out pogo pin hole to 1.5mm.  Note that the pin is at an angle so as to engage with the BNC ring
4) drill out resistor hole to approximately  3.4mm
5) install pogo pin and resistor.  rear resistor lead should rest in the groove in the inside wall.  front resistor lead is bent over to tough the side of the pogo pin and trimmed
6) *carefully* solder the resistor lead to the pogo pin, avoiding soldering it up completely solid
7) prepare the BNC by filing a ~2.6mm groove in the end rim.  Some already have this if they previously had a plastic shroud. I'd suggest doing it next to the solid part, not the locking slot
7) push fit BNC connector being careful not to push out the resistor.  some epoxy may help, depending on clearances
